            <article>
                <p>When I enrolled in this course, I was initially most excited about being able to expand my knowledge
                    and skills in coding and programming. Before taking this course, I had little experience with HTML
                    and CSS and was completely unfamiliar with PHP. However, as I navigated through the weekly lectures,
                    I became more intrigued with learning more about bias in technology, and how it interferes with and
                    disables certain groups of people from being able to access and properly execute the functionality
                    of technology. I was familiar with how people from minority backgrounds had trouble accessing the
                    internet or technology, but I wasn’t aware until this course that even when these groups were able
                    to get online, there would be even more bias and obstacles for them to overcome. As the course
                    progressed and was coming to an end, we were told that we would need to design a website and survey
                    that addresses the issues of bias that we have learned throughout the course, and I was excited to
                    learn how my peers perceived bias in the tech industry, especially in regards to gender.
                </p>

                <p>At the start of this project, I constantly referenced back to the readings that were assigned from
                    Algorithms of Oppression. In the first chapter, Saafiyah Noble focused on how search engines
                    continue to uphold stereotypes of women and their “inability” to be anything more than a housewife
                    or submissive to the men in their lives (p. 15). In the second chapter, Noble decided to focus on
                    women of color who were constantly being sexualized on the internet, with a simple search of “black
                    girls” resulting in pages holding titles such as “Black Booty on the Beach” and other illicit
                    content (p.64). It seemed as though the internet was out to hurt women, and when women tried to
                    enter the industry and make a change, they faced even more oppression from those in their workplace.
                    That’s why my group decided to focus our survey on gender bias in the tech industry, as we wanted to
                    know how one can have a bias against women as they try to make an advancement in the tech industry
                    but continuously face obstacles in being able to do so. We wanted to ask questions as to how one
                    perceives a woman’s contribution and role in the tech industry, as well as the hardships she may
                    have on the journey there and once she finally gets into the tech industry. Most of our test takers
                    turned out to be men, and it helped us to gain an understanding of how the opposite sex views women
                    in the tech world and how much of a bias they subconsciously hold.
                </p>
                <p>Working in a remote-paired programming session made me more aware of these faults in the tech world
                    by allowing me to see it first-hand and behind the scenes. After learning the basics of HTML, CSS,
                    and PHP, I could understand how it can be difficult to ensure that everything functions correctly
                    and is able to be accessed by all groups of people. However, it also made me realize that there are
                    easy solutions to these problems, and when it comes to design, you have to take into consideration
                    your audience at the very beginning to make sure that you’re designing inclusively. That’s why for
                    our project, we tried to make our website layout as accessible as possible, making sure that it was
                    easy to navigate and understand. We took into account the feedback we received from our peers as
                    they were our initial audience, and it helped our group to make improvements so that we could have
                    an inclusive design and inclusive questions in our survey. However, there were some difficulties
                    working remotely, as it was hard to ensure that every member of our group was on the same page in
                    our understanding of how we wanted our website to come across and what our goal was. It was even
                    more difficult when we struggled to find a way to host our website while also letting us all have
                    access to the coding files so we could all contribute to the layout of the website equally. In the
                    end, however, we were able to come together as a group and work well together in explaining to one
                    another how we envisioned our site. Additionally, we always addressed any concerns we had and were
                    able to fix them head-on, with each of us always trying to find a solution to our problems.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, this course has allowed me to gain an understanding of how the tech industry works and the
                    bias that is being held in such a world. I hope that the knowledge and skills that I’ve learned in
                    regard to coding can help me to ensure that whatever designs I make in the future take into account
                    all groups of people, making it inclusive and easily accessible as much as possible.</p>
