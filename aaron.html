            <article>
                <p>Before taking this course I had some experience programming with HTML and CSS, and I was interested
                    in taking this course so I could also learn some PHP which is very widely used, but also so I could
                    learn about the social impacts of being a developer as someone who will be working as a software
                    engineer in the near future. After completing this course I can say that I am now more aware about
                    the issues that can be propagated by technology.
                </p>

                <p>Building the website for this project made me look back on the reading from The Young and the
                    Digital, and the lecture on Digital Aesthetics and Race. The differences between the ways people
                    used services like MySpace and Facebook are a prime example of intersectionality in tech. This is
                    evident in the way role class and race had, where Facebook was viewed from the perspective of being
                    for people at elite universities and of upper class, while MySpace was for lower class people and
                    minorities. Facebook users preferred their platform because it was more exclusive since only people
                    with email addresses from Ivy League Schools could be engaged, and they considered the user
                    interface to be more uniform and clean. MySpace on the other hand provided the ability for users to
                    edit the HTML and CSS on their profiles. In Digital Gates it says "MySpace's system features
                    encourage customization and personalization"(80). From the perspective of Facebook users, "Facebook
                    [is] 'pretty, simple, and classy''"(81). We know from the lecture on Digital Aesthetics and Race
                    that large tech companies, like Facebook, like using minimalist and clean designs for their product
                    aesthetics. Working in a remote-paired programming environment made me more aware of these issues in
                    the way that we all had different inputs when creating our website. For some people it was their
                    first experience with programming and creating websites while others already had some previous
                    experience. As a group we met over Zoom to create our site, and this often meant that one person
                    could share their screen at a time and code. While creating our website we wanted to have a website
                    that was vibrant and easy to use, but that had a nice touch of color and elements that popped out.
                    The group made decisions as a whole on the outline and styling of the website, and we also
                    incorporated feedback from our testing phase. We made changes to the survey portion such as removing
                    unnecessary blockers like requiring an email address to submit your survey.
                </p>
                <p>For our project we focused on Gender Bias in Tech, and it made me look back on ideas of
                    intersectionality that were presented in Algorithms of Oppression and in the ideas from lectures and
                    readings regarding meritocracy. I thought the issue of pay and how it relates to the idea of
                    meritocracy was an important idea to be surveyed as it is an issue that to me seems to be often
                    overlooked throughout the tech industry. In Algorithms of Oppression it states “For example, in the
                    midst of a federal investigation of Google’s alleged persistent wage gap, where women are
                    systematically paid less than men in the company’s workforce, an “antidiversity” manifesto authored
                    by James Damore went viral” (2). We added questions to our survey “On average, men receive a higher
                    compensation than women who share the same level of experience in the tech industry” and “I believe
                    women are less likely to negotiate their compensation in comparison to men” because questions from
                    the Harvard Implicit Bias test did not seem to address these issues. It’s pretty evident that there
                    are persistent issues regarding meritocracy in the tech industry today.

                </p>
                <p>Overall, I believe this course has helped me improve my awareness of issues that currently plague the
                    tech industry, and also with improving my technical skills. I would say that I am now able to think
                    more critically about intersectionality, race and gender issues, and the overall impact that code
                    has on the world we live in today.
