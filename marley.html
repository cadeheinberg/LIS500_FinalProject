            <article>
                <p>Before completing this course, I had limited to no experience working with a variety of platforms
                    focused on including HTML, PHP, CSS, etc. Instead of taking a simple introduction to programming
                    course, I chose LIS 500 in hopes of not only developing my programming skills but additionally
                    becoming more aware of the unconscious biases and stereotypes that occur through technology. While
                    this course was most definitely challenging, it was extremely rewarding, specifically my takeaways
                    from this project.</p>

                <p>As we began developing our survey, I initially thought about "Algorithms of Oppression”, in which we
                    learned that search results vary depending on the user that is searching them. That is a primary
                    example of intersectionality in tech, and we wanted to ensure that our survey was uniform for all
                    survey takers, no matter their prior internet usage and demographic characteristics. By doing this
                    we ensured that our survey was anonymous and had the same questions for all users. Additionally,
                    earlier in the semester I specifically took the Harvard Implicit Bias test focused on Gender Career.
                    While taking it, I noticed a lack of questions regarding those with actual and first-hand
                    experiences of biases in the industry. We wanted our project to specifically address issues learned
                    in the course such as “imposter syndrome” and “meritocracy” that specifically provide results on
                    unconscious biases for individuals' experiences in the workplace. By doing so, we included a primary
                    question that identifies a pattern of women feeling imposter syndrome in the tech workplace more
                    than men. Beth Andres Beck’s article “Confidence Through Feedback, or Why Imposter Syndrome is the
                    Wrong Metaphor", states the deeper reasoning as to why imposter syndrome occurs and what it means,
                    “Imposter syndrome is often presented as a personal failing. A lack of confidence, our wrong-headed
                    beliefs not matching the reality of how competent we are, or worse of a flaw of our gender”. This
                    completely shifted my thinking to realize that women experience increased imposter syndrome because
                    they are in environments where they don’t have sufficient role models and therefore feel less secure
                    and confident in their positions. Including a survey question about both female tech role models and
                    imposter syndrome works to shift survey takers' mindsets to understand that unconscious biases can
                    be relevant to these less obvious topics and involve real-life experiences for women in the
                    industry.
                </p>

                <p>When considering the remote-paired programming environment that my group members and I collaborated
                    within when creating our final project, it was interesting to see the differences in which all of us
                    tackled the assignment. We each had a variety of opinions on the topic and aesthetics of the website
                    that we needed to work out via Zoom. All of us had experienced the course in different ways and had
                    different backgrounds which resulted in various levels of comfortability towards programming for the
                    project. Some of us felt more comfortable sharing our screens and teaching each other, while others
                    did not. We eventually developed a remote environment where we all felt safe to share our thoughts
                    and experiences, ask each other questions, and insert our opinions. I initially thought the paired
                    programming would consist of one person coding while the others watch, after practice and an
                    understanding of each other's strengths we were able to entrust each other with different aspects of
                    the projects, as well as learn skills from each teammate regarding edits to the code and design of
                    the website.</p>

                <p>When we began to design our site, I individually reflected on the Video Lecture Material “Digital
                    Aesthetics & Race” and a course reading regarding aesthetics “Digital Gates”, which we read at the
                    beginning of the semester. The look and aesthetics of our website result in potential changes of use
                    and stereotypical results. For example, different audiences utilized MySpace from Facebook, “MySpace
                    carefully cultivated a demeanor that is personal, whimsical and at times, oppositional. Facebook, on
                    the other hand, has maintained a relatively stable and uniform presentation” (Page 81, Digital
                    Gates). Using the knowledge we gained from this source, we wanted to develop a website that was more
                    Scandinavian style. Simple yet still colorful and enjoyable for all users. We felt that it was
                    important to all explain our preferences and after that delegate different aspects to different
                    peers. That way we ensured that we were aware of all of our opinions when developing a website that
                    could address intersectionality issues.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, this course and the final project allowed me to take a deeper look into all material that I
                    both create for the web as well as the content I interact with online. I have learned the prime
                    aspects of intersectionality, racial and gender disparities in the technology industries, the
                    details of meritocracy, and much more. This project allowed me to not only further my skills in
                    programming but also learn how to interact with peers when programming to develop a final product.
