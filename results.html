      <article>
        <p>We chose to focuse on gender bias in the tech industry, a topic we discussed heavily in our articles and
          lectures and after reading Algorithms of Oppression. After taking the Harvard Implicit Bias test we were
          inspired to create a version focused on gender bias.</p>

        <p>In constructing this survey, we are hoping to extrapolate meaningful data that will provide insight on how
          people view gender bias in the tech industry. Please click the button above to begin the survey!</p>
        <p>These results will be updated once we receive survey results</p>
