            <article>
                <p>We began our process by making our implicit bias survey was to find group members to work on the
                    project with. We formed a group by using canvas discussion tools to contact each other. Once our
                    group was formed, we met over Zoom to talk about our ideas for the project. Although we could not
                    meet in person, we formed meaningful connections with each other and found things in common that we
                    wanted to explore further in our survey.
                </p>

                <p>In our first zoom meeting, we looked at surveys like the Harvard Implicit Bias and began
                    brainstorming different ideas for how we would host the site, the theme of it, and most importantly
                    the questions. For hosting the website, we first investigated WordPress. WordPress offered great
                    services and themes, but we would not be able to add our own code. We faced issues uploading our own
                    files and creating PHP pages. We went with GitHub instead. Although PHP pages aren’t supported, we
                    would have complete control over our code and multiple group members can submit proposals for
                    changes to be made to the site since they could download the source code and make modifications
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <p>Over the next few weeks, we built the site from scratch and incorporated different pages that we
                    thought our users would find engaging. We decided to create a survey about Gender Bias in Tech based
                    on our experiences and we were also inspired by the book Algorithms of Oppression. The focus of the
                    survey was on people’s perspectives about what it is like for different genders to work and be a
                    part of the tech industry. We formatted our questions similarly to each other, and we formatted the
                    questions in a way to be able to measure different levels of bias a surveyor might have. Algorithms
                    of Oppression illustrated the underlying racism and sexism that is exhibited just by using search
                    engines such as Google. Google, being one of the largest tech companies in the world, has created
                    search results with “autosuggestion features including women should not have rights to vote, work,
                    drive, be trusted” and much more (p.15). If these search results were feasible and unnoticed by
                    many, it led us to question the environment of the company that creates this search engine.
                </p>
                <p>By focusing our survey on Gender Bias in tech, we could question the environments of large tech
                    corporations and future tech employees. Technology companies pride themselves on being meritocratic,
                    however after watching the PBS interview “How Ellen Pao realized women ‘cannot succeed’ in Silicon
                    Valley frat boy culture”, it became clear that gender bias is extremely relevant in Silicon Valley,
                    regardless of a meritocratic environment. We wanted to construct a survey that both identifies
                    unconscious biases regarding the current gender gap in tech as well as what policies have led to
                    this environment.
                </p>
                <p>To improve our survey, we enlisted the help of our peers from the course. We received feedback on our
                    design and accessibility, as well as some confusion with the wording of our questions. We modified
                    our code so that visitors were seeing less redundancy in our page overview and so that users were
                    able to identify and put a name to each member of our team. Students pointed out that our survey was
                    embedded improperly and provided us with advice on how we could improve the layout of our test. This
                    resulted in us incorporating Formfacade as a plugin to our Google Form so that we could gather data
                    easily and provide our test takers with their results based on our bias scale. This allowed our
                    users to see where they fall in having or not having a bias concerning gender in the tech industry.

                </p>
                <p>When deciding what kind of questions we would like to ask our survey participants, we collectively
                    agreed to incorporate concepts we learned throughout the course. We decided to include a question
                    about imposter syndrome, which is defined as someone believing they are insufficient in their work
                    and their position, making them feel as though they are an imposter. We learned that this could
                    result in people not receiving critical feedback. To gain insight into whether people believe that
                    this syndrome exists in the tech industry, we decided to ask if people believe that women
                    specifically are more prone to having imposter syndrome in the tech industry. Since most of our test
                    takers were male, we believe that we don’t have enough information to gain a full understanding of
                    how someone may be biased against women feeling as though they are an imposter in a predominantly
                    male industry. Additionally, although we have included references so that test takers can gain a
                    better understanding of the term, we are left not knowing how everyone conceptualizes the term.
                </p>
                <p>The results from our survey showed very different results between males and females. Male test takers
                    were the dominant demographic of our results and they scored around the high 30s and female test
                    takers scored around the low 20s indicating that there is a higher level of bias among men towards
                    women who work in the tech industry. Male test-takers agreed with statements such as “Women in
                    executive positions are more likely to have imposter syndrome in the tech industry in comparison to
                    their male counterparts” and “I believe that women are less likely to receive mentoring and career
                    development opportunities in the tech industry compared to men”. Additionally, from many articles
                    included in our course material, it is clear many people are calling for a change in the tech
                    industry; however, our survey results portray that 34% of users feel “Neutral” about whether a
                    change is necessary. To those who do see a need for a change in the tech industry, what specific
                    steps do you think will be most meaningful toward closing the gender gap? For those who do not see
                    the need for change, do you feel like an environment currently exists that values female voices in
                    the industry?
